# Automobile-Sales-Analysis

This project involves customer segmentation, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization to derive insights from the 'Automobile Sales' dataset

#Overview
The primary goal of this project is to understand customer behavior, identify patterns, and segment customers based on Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) analysis. Additionally, exploratory data analysis and visualizations are employed to gain insights into the dataset.

#Tools and Libraries Used
NumPy and Pandas for data manipulation and analysis. 

Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization. 

Plotly for interactive visualizations.

#Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The EDA phase involves:

Data loading and initial inspection. Checking for missing values. 

Handling outliers in sales-related metrics. 

Exploring the distribution of key numerical features. 

Analyzing sales trends over time. Visualizing sales across different product lines. Investigating the distribution of deal sizes.

#Visualizations
Several visualizations have been created to enhance the understanding of the dataset:

Horizontal bar plots for the top 10 customers based on total sales, recency, and frequency. 

Funnel chart depicting the distribution of the top 10 countries. 

Bar chart illustrating the distribution of deal sizes. Pie chart showcasing the sales contribution by deal size categories.

#RFM Analysis
RFM analysis involves:

Calculating Recency, Frequency, and Monetary metrics for each customer. 

Assigning RFM scores and segments based on quantiles. 

Assigning RFM segments such as 'High Value,' 'Mid Value,' and 'Low Value.' 

Creating a bar chart for RFM segmentation distribution.

#Usage
Explore the Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks/ directory for detailed analyses and visualizations. 

The processed dataset with RFM segments is available in Auto Sales data.csv and RFM_Segmentation.csv
